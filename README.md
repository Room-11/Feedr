Feedr
=====

Provides RSS feeds for GitHub

Status and possible future developments
---------------------------------------

Currently only actual GitHub releases will be used in the feeds. So just git tagging is not enough.

In the future I will also include normal git tagged versions.
Also in the future there will be the possibility to add users instead of separate repositories.
