Feedr

Provides RSS feeds for GitHub

Status and possible future developments
---------------------------------------

Currently only actual GitHub releases will be used in the feeds. So just git tagging is not enough.

In the future I will also include normal git tagged versions.
Also in the future there will be the possibility to add users instead of separate repositories.

Oh yeah, the code sucks BTW don't look...
